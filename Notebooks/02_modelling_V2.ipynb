    "### Project Objective\n",
    "This notebook aims to build a predictive model to estimate hospital readmission outcomes for diabetes patients. The target variable, readmitted, has three classes: NO, <30 days, and >30 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: \n",
    "Accurate predictions of readmission risk can help hospitals allocate resources more efficiently. Patients identified as high risk (especially those likely to return within 30 days) can receive tailored interventions, improved monitoring, or optimized discharge planning. This may reduce unnecessary readmissions and improve bed and staff utilization."

    "### Note: Why the <30 Days Readmission Class Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Readmissions within 30 days are widely used in healthcare as a key quality indicator. They often signal unresolved medical issues, inadequate discharge planning, or complications that arise shortly after the patient leaves the hospital. Hospitals typically monitor this category closely because these readmissions are considered more preventable and are sometimes tied to financial or performance evaluations.\n",
    "For this reason, achieving strong model performance on the <30 class is particularly valuable for clinical decision-making and resource planning."

    "\n",
    "Begin with a simple baseline model such as Logistic Regression to establish reference performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. If performance is limited, explore more complex algorithms including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Bagging and Boosting methods, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Each model will be tuned through appropriate hyperparameters to improve predictive performance.\n",
